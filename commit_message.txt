fix(Import): Overhaul data cleaning and type casting

- Implemented a definitive, robust data import script in wsgi.py. 
- This version handles missing columns, typos, non-numeric values, and out-of-range integers gracefully by coercing all problematic data to safe defaults and explicitly casting data types before database insertion. 
- This is the final fix for all data import errors.
